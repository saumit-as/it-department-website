                <hr>
                <p>&ensp;&#9;Cyber Security or information technology Security is a field within information technology
                  involving the protection of computer systems and the prevention of unauthorized use or changes or
                  access of electronic data. It deals with the protection of software, hardware, networks and its
                  information. Due to the heavy reliance on computers in the modern industry that store and transmit an
                  abundance of confidential information about people, cyber security is a critical function and needed
                  insurance of many businesses. It also protects computer systems from theft or damage.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Regardless of the reasons for the increase in demand, the pressing problem is a shortage of people
                  trained and capable enough to fill the growing number of cyber security roles. NASSCOM reports that
                  despite having the largest IT talent pool in the world, India simply lacks skilled cyber security
                  professionals. In fact, the need for experienced professionals is so high that companies are willing
                  to pay a premium salary of over Rs 1.5 to 4 crore to top talent. This has increased the cyber security
                  budget by 71% as observed by PwC in its 2016 report.</p>
